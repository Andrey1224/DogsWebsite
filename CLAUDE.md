Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.

Inter-file context: `Spec1.md` is the product requirements source that informs roadmap
priorities. `SPRINT_PLAN.md` breaks that spec into execution sprints and references the
same feature set. `AGENTS.md` is the contributor guide that explains how to work within
those plans, while this `CLAUDE.md` captures agent-specific operating rules. Review the
spec first, then the sprint plan, then follow `AGENTS.md` so all guidance stays aligned.
