# Project History

Central hub for all project changes, milestones, and architectural decisions.

## Navigation

- **[📜 Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)**: High-level timeline of features and fixes.
- **[🏃 Sprints](./sprints/)**: Detailed reports for each sprint (0-5).
- **[🗄️ Archive](./archive/)**: Deep dive technical reports and legacy specifications.

## How to add history

1. Significant features should be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Large technical initiatives (like LCP optimization) should have a standalone report in `archive/`.
3. Sprint completions should have a summary in `sprints/`.
