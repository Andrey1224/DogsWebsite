- **ðŸŽ¯ TARGET ACHIEVED: â‰¥50% lines coverage exceeded (52.57%)**
- Status per objective:
  - Contact Intake Hardening â€” **Completed** (server + rate-limit suites merged; contact-form client-side validation added with 22 tests).
  - Reservations & Payments â€” **Completed** (queries.ts now 74.71% lines / 96% functions; directory at 68.11% lines / 57.14% branches / 82.14% functions).
  - Analytics & Configuration â€” **Completed** (GA server events + env/config coverage).
  - Captcha & External Clients â€” **Completed** (hCaptcha covered; Stripe client 100% lines, PayPal client 100% lines).
  - UI Smoke Coverage â€” **âœ… COMPLETED** (Marketing pages + contact-form + a11y: 74 new tests total).
  - E2E Enhancements â€” Deferred (prioritized unit/component coverage first).
  - Guardrails â€” **COMPLETED** (thresholds met and exceeded).

## Detailed Tracker
| Area | Owner | Status | Notes | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contact Intake Hardening | Dev | Completed | Server action + rate-limit suites landed; `app/contact` at 74.57% lines. | Snapshot assertions optional; no further action required unless QA requests. |
| Reservations & Payments | Dev | **Completed** | Added comprehensive test suites for `queries.ts` (25 tests), covering ReservationQueries, PuppyQueries, WebhookEventQueries, edge cases; directory now **68.11% lines** / **57.14% branches** / **82.14% functions** (thresholds exceeded). `queries.ts` specifically: 74.71% lines / 96% functions. Ratcheted thresholds to 60/75/55/60. | Monitor regressions; extend idempotency/create.ts if new scenarios emerge. |
| Webhook Edge Paths (Stripe/PayPal) | Dev | In progress | Stripe stale-event + invalid amount guards and PayPal capture status validation added. Signature mismatch + additional Stripe/PayPal failure scenarios still TODO. | Implement signature mismatch simulation, stale order handling, and additional metadata drift checks. |
| Idempotency Manager | Dev | In progress | Generator + webhook duplication + key retries plus processed/failed/cleanup/pending coverage landed. | Cover Supabase-backed `checkWebhookEvent` branches once shared fixtures support stateful rows. |
| Analytics & Config | Dev | Completed | GA server event suite + env/config tests implemented; `lib/analytics/server-events.ts` now 92% lines, env utils 77%. | Monitor regressions; expand contact config coverage if scope changes. |
| Captcha & External Clients | Dev | **Completed** | hCaptcha verification now unit-tested across success/failure paths. **Stripe client: 100% lines** (5 tests: config guards, init, webhook secret). **PayPal client: 100% lines** (17 tests: config guards, env validation, access token caching, order creation/capture, error handling). | Monitor regressions; extend webhook handler tests if new payment scenarios emerge. |
| UI Smoke & A11y | Dev | **âœ… COMPLETED** | **Session 4 Final:** Added **74 new tests** including: (1) **contact-form.test.tsx**: 22 tests covering rendering, form fields, validation, captcha integration, error handling, accessibility. (2) **tests/a11y/pages.test.tsx**: 36 tests covering all marketing pages (Home, About, Contact, FAQ, Policies, Reviews) with axe-core accessibility validation. (3) **tests/a11y/components.test.tsx**: 16 tests covering ContactForm, SiteHeader, SiteFooter, ContactBar with a11y checks. **Installed:** jest-axe + canvas for accessibility testing. **Total UI coverage:** 22 (marketing pages) + 22 (contact-form) + 36 (a11y pages) + 16 (a11y components) = **96 UI tests**. | Monitor regressions; extend to dynamic pages (puppy detail) if needed. |
| E2E Enhancements | Dev/QA | Not started | Playwright limited to catalog/contact happy path. | Extend to rate-limit scenario, filter matrix, checkout stubs with traces/videos. |
| Guardrails & Tooling | Dev | **âœ… COMPLETED** | Vitest thresholds met and exceeded: **global 40/70/60/40** (achieved 52.57% lines, 74.88% functions, 65.41% branches). Directory-specific thresholds: `lib/reservations/**` 60/75/55/60, `lib/analytics/**` 70/70/60/70, `lib/inquiries/**` 95/95/90/95. Playwright retries/video/trace configured. | Maintain thresholds; add JUnit output & coverage badge in CI if requested. |

## Blockers / Risks
- âœ… **RESOLVED:** Contact coverage achieved with contact-form.test.tsx (22 tests).
- âœ… **RESOLVED:** UI Smoke & A11y coverage achieved with 96 total UI tests.
- E2E Enhancements deferred to future sprint (prioritized unit/component coverage).
- Future: May need deterministic clock + stateful mocks for advanced webhook scenarios.

## Decisions & Notes
- Plan documented in `TEST_PLAN.md` (2025-02-17).
- Coverage snapshot recorded via `npm run test -- --coverage`; refer to `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` for HTML report.
- **Sprint 5 Session 1 (2025-02-17):** Added 19 new tests for `lib/reservations/queries.ts`, covering all query classes (ReservationQueries, PuppyQueries, WebhookEventQueries). Overall coverage jumped from 26.76% â†’ 33.17% lines, 23.44% â†’ 61.89% branches.
- **Sprint 5 Session 2 (2025-02-17):** Added 22 new tests for external payment clients (`lib/stripe/client.ts`, `lib/paypal/client.ts`). Both achieved 100% line coverage. Overall coverage now: 35.26% lines, 64.08% branches, 75.25% functions. Total: 139 tests (+41 from start).
- **Sprint 5 Session 3 (2025-02-17):** Added 22 new tests for marketing pages (`app/about/page.tsx`, `app/puppies/page.tsx`, `app/reviews/page.tsx`). Coverage jumped 44.15% lines (+8.89%), 76.32% functions (+1.07%). Total: 161 tests (+63 from start).
- **ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 5 Session 4 FINAL (2025-02-17):** Added **74 new tests** for UI Smoke & A11y coverage:
  - **components/contact-form.test.tsx**: 22 tests (rendering, fields, validation, captcha, errors, a11y)
  - **tests/a11y/pages.test.tsx**: 36 tests (Home, About, Contact, FAQ, Policies, Reviews with axe-core)
  - **tests/a11y/components.test.tsx**: 16 tests (ContactForm, SiteHeader, SiteFooter, ContactBar)
  - **Dependencies installed:** jest-axe, @axe-core/react, canvas
  - **Final coverage:** 52.57% lines (+8.42%), 74.88% functions (-1.44%), 65.41% branches (+1.64%)
  - **Total: 235 tests passing** (+74 from session 3, +137 from sprint start)
  - **âœ… TARGET ACHIEVED: â‰¥50% lines coverage exceeded**
- Prioritized unit/component coverage over E2E for maximum ROI; E2E deferred to future sprint.
- Playwright retries (2) with `trace: "on-first-retry"` and `video: "retain-on-failure"` configured for future E2E expansion.
