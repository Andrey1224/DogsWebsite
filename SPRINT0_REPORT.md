# Sprint 0 Report

## Completed
- Scaffolded the Next.js 15 App Router workspace with Tailwind, strict TypeScript, and shared directories (`components`, `lib`, `supabase`, `tests`).
- Added DX tooling: ESLint (flat config), Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright, and CI workflow running lint → typecheck → test → e2e → build.
- Provisioned baseline assets: security headers in `next.config.ts`, temporary `robots.txt`, `.env.example` placeholders pre-populated with Supabase/Stripe/PayPal keys, updated `README.md`, and smoke content on the home page.
- Authored and executed the initial Supabase SQL migration (parents, litters, puppies, reservations, inquiries) with RLS enabled and helper trigger for `updated_at`.
- Secured environment configuration: `.env.local` carries Supabase, Stripe (publishable/secret/webhook), PayPal sandbox, Crisp Website ID, and values mirrored into GitHub/Vercel secrets.
- Verified all quality gates locally (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run e2e`, `npm run build`).

## Pending / Deferred
- Mirror GA4 Measurement ID and Meta Pixel ID once analytics is ready (not required for current dev work).
- Configure Vercel Preview/Production domains and confirm environment variables once deployment strategy is finalized.
- Define Supabase RLS policies per role (deferred until Sprint 2 security hardening).

## Next Suggested Steps
- Begin Sprint 1 tasks from `SPRINT_PLAN.md` (catalog data access, puppy listing UI, inquiry flow).
- Seed Supabase tables with starter content for development once schema review is complete.
- Decide on consent tooling approach before enabling analytics pixels.
