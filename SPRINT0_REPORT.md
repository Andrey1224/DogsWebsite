# Sprint 0 Report

## Completed
- Scaffolded Next.js 15 App Router workspace with Tailwind, TypeScript strict mode, and shared directories (`components`, `lib`, `supabase`, `tests`).
- Added DX tooling: ESLint (flat config), Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright, and CI workflow running lint → typecheck → test → e2e → build.
- Provisioned baseline assets: security headers in `next.config.ts`, temporary `robots.txt`, `.env.example` placeholders (populated with Supabase URL), updated `README.md`, and smoke content on the home page.
- Authored initial Supabase SQL migration aligning with `Spec1.md` (parents, litters, puppies, reservations, inquiries).
- Verified quality gates locally (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run e2e`, `npm run build`).

## Pending / Needs Input
- Supabase project creation, schema migration import, storage buckets, and RLS configuration.
- Vercel project wiring (env vars, Preview/Production deployments) and domain preferences.
- Third-party keys: Crisp website ID, GA4 Measurement ID, Meta Pixel ID, Stripe + PayPal sandbox credentials.
- Decision on analytics consent tooling and any organization-specific CI/CD requirements (e.g., required secrets, Slack alerts).

## Next Suggested Steps
- Populate `.env.local` with the issued credentials and share encrypted copies for CI.
- Run `npx playwright install --with-deps` in CI or bake browsers into the pipeline image.
- Begin Sprint 1 tasks from `SPRINT_PLAN.md` after approving the outstanding integrations.
