## 🚨 Important Reminders for Future Sprints

### Content Pending Client Approval
1. **FAQ Content** — Current text is draft quality; requires final review before public launch (noted in Phase 3)
2. **Review Photos** — Placeholder images in use; client to provide final testimonial photos
3. **Hero Images** — Current catalog hero images are temporary; optimize to WebP/AVIF ≤400KB when finals arrive

### Pre-Release Checklist
1. Replace placeholder review photos with client-approved assets
2. Optimize all hero images (currently ~2.5MB → target ≤400KB)
3. Re-run Lighthouse audits after final imagery (target Performance ≥90)
4. Verify Google Business Profile NAP consistency
5. Submit `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console
6. Capture final Rich Results Test screenshots for documentation
7. Update Vercel environment variables if LAT/LNG/HOURS change

### Production Deployment Notes
- **NAP Validation:** Coordinates validated at 95 County Road 1395, Falkville, AL 35622 (34.3698, -86.9084)
- **Environment Sync:** Ensure Vercel production env matches `.env.example` for all `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_*` variables
- **GBP Sync:** Confirm Google Business Profile uses identical NAP/hours before launch
- **Media Pipeline:** All final images must be processed through WebP/AVIF optimization (≤400KB, 1600–1920px)

### Technical Debt
- None identified in this sprint
- Hero image optimization deferred until client provides production assets (performance trade-off acceptable for staging)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Centralized SEO/structured data helpers reduced code duplication
- Context7 MCP integration accelerated Next.js 15 best practices adoption
- Breadcrumbs + JSON-LD pattern reusable across all paginated content
- Image optimization pipeline (blur placeholder + preload) significantly improved LCP

### What Could Be Improved
- Content approval process should gate schema implementation (FAQ text changed post-schema)
- Lighthouse audits should run against production-like assets (local CDN failures skewed metrics)
- Google Business Profile sync should be validated earlier in sprint

### Recommendations for Next Sprint
- Establish content freeze checkpoint before schema generation
- Set up Vercel preview branch with production CDN for accurate Lighthouse scores
- Create GBP audit checklist as part of DoD
