# Sprint 2 Report â€” Contacts, Chat, Analytics

## Highlights
- Hooked the contact form to Supabase via a server action with Zod validation, rate limiting, and hCaptcha (test bypass enabled locally).
- Instrumented Crisp chat with availability events, WhatsApp fallbacks, and consent-aware GA4/Meta Pixel tracking for key engagement events.
- Centralised contact details behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_*` env vars so the contact bar, Crisp copy, analytics payloads, and docs stay in sync.
- Hardened CI for the contact flow (Playwright unique emails, required env injection in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Completed Work
- Contact pipeline: `components/contact-form.tsx`, `app/contact/actions.ts`, `lib/inquiries/*`, `lib/captcha/hcaptcha.ts`.
- Chat presence + contact bar updates: `components/crisp-chat.tsx`, `components/contact-bar.tsx`, `lib/config/contact.ts` (now env-driven).
- Analytics & consent: `components/analytics-provider.tsx`, `components/consent-banner.tsx`, GA/Pixel wiring in `app/layout.tsx`.
- CI & tests: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` env matrix, Playwright unique email flow in `tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts`, plus `lib/inquiries/schema.test.ts`.
- Docs & env templates: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.example`, `SPRINT_PLAN.md`.

## Follow-ups / Risks
- Verify Supabase keys and contact env vars are present in Vercel/GitHub secrets; redeploy after any key regeneration.
- Await production contact details + hCaptcha keys to replace placeholders and remove bypass tokens before go-live.
- Need analytics IDs (GA4, Meta Pixel) to validate telemetry end-to-end.
- Future work: wire inquiry notifications, Stripe/PayPal deposits (Sprint 3), and expand integration tests once submissions mutate data.

## Metrics & QA
- Lint, typecheck, Vitest, and Playwright suites pass locally (captcha bypass required for e2e).
- Supabase seed verified post-import; inquiries insert path exercised via bypass token.

## Next Sprint Preview
- Sprint 3 focuses on deposit flows (Stripe/PayPal), reservation status updates, and webhook logging/alerts.
