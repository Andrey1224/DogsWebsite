    question: "How do I place a deposit?",
    answer:
      "Open the puppy’s detail page and tap Reserve with Stripe or PayPal. The $300 deposit immediately marks the puppy as reserved while we finalize your contract and pickup timeline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the deposit refundable?",
    answer:
      "Deposits are non-refundable because we pause all other inquiries for that puppy. If your timing changes, we can transfer the deposit to another available or upcoming puppy by agreement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the pickup and delivery options?",
    answer:
      "You can pick up in Montgomery by appointment or choose courier delivery. We partner with trusted ground transport and flight nannies; travel fees are quoted at cost and due prior to departure.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents come with the puppy?",
    answer:
      "Every puppy goes home with a licensed veterinary health certificate, vaccination and deworming record, microchip registration details, and a starter guide for nutrition and training.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we visit before reserving?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Kennel visits are available by appointment once you complete the inquiry form. We also provide live video walkthroughs for families who cannot travel.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know the site is legitimate?",

      "All payments are processed by Stripe or PayPal—never direct transfers. You’ll receive automated confirmations, contracts, and ongoing communication from our team for full peace of mind.",
