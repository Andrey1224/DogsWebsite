# Test Coverage Sprint – Consolidated Report

**Date:** 2025-02-17  
**Authoring Agent:** Claude Code

This document unifies the planning, execution, verification, and checklist records for the Sprint 5 test coverage initiative. It preserves the full context captured previously across `TEST_PLAN.md`, `TEST_PROGRESS.md`, `TEST_SUMMARY.md`, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`, and `FINAL_CHECKLIST.md`.

---

## 1. Objectives & Scope

- **Primary Objective:** Raise automated coverage from ~21% lines / 61% statements to ≥50% lines / ≥65% statements, focusing on contact intake, reservations/payments, and marketing surfaces.
- **Status:** ✅ **Achieved**
- **Initial Baseline (Vitest v3.2.4, V8 provider):**
  - Lines 21.04% | Statements 21.04% | Functions 60.83% | Branches 61.27%
  - Total tests: 98
- **Final Metrics (Session 4 complete):**
  - Lines **52.57%** | Statements **52.57%** | Functions **74.88%** | Branches **65.41%**
  - Total tests: **235** (+137 from baseline)
- **Key Deliverable Areas:**
  1. Contact intake hardening
  2. Reservations & payments coverage
  3. Analytics & configuration validation
  4. Captcha & external client mocks
  5. UI smoke + accessibility coverage
  6. Guardrails (coverage thresholds, lint rules)
  7. E2E enhancement planning (deferred)

Deferred items: rate-limit E2E scenarios, catalog filter matrix, checkout runs, CI artifacts (JUnit, coverage badge), Playwright trace/video retention, contact snapshot assertions, webhook signature edge cases.

## 3. Scope Completion Summary

1. **Contact Intake Hardening**  
   - `app/contact/actions.ts` (94.96%) exercises success, captcha failure, rate-limit, Supabase error paths.  
   - `lib/inquiries/rate-limit.ts` (96.22%) covers allow/block, missing IP, datastore errors.  
   - `components/contact-form.test.tsx` delivers 22 client-side validation and accessibility tests.  
   - Optional snapshot/email fallback work left for future.

2. **Reservations & Payments**  
   - `lib/reservations/queries.ts` 25-test suite pushes file to 74.71% lines / 96% functions.  
   - `lib/reservations/create.ts` (16 tests) & `idempotency.ts` (8 tests) cover concurrency, dedupe, cleanup flows.  
   - Stripe/PayPal webhook handlers hardened (stale event, invalid amount, capture status).  
   - Directory coverage: 68.11% lines / 57.14% branches / 82.14% functions.

3. **Analytics & Configuration**  
   - `lib/analytics/server-events.ts` (92%), `lib/config/business.ts` (66.66%), `lib/utils/env.ts` (77.35%) now validated.  
   - Consent-gated tracking, business profile normalization, env validation scenarios covered.

4. **Captcha & External Clients**  
   - `lib/captcha/hcaptcha.ts` at 94% lines / 80% branches (bypass token, error codes).  
   - Stripe & PayPal clients both at 100% coverage, including token caching and failure handling.

5. **UI Smoke & Accessibility**  
   - Marketing pages: 22 component tests across Home/About/Puppies/Reviews.  
   - Contact form UI: 22 tests covering rendering, context propagation, validation, captcha states.  
   - Accessibility suites: 52 jest-axe powered tests (pages + components) with custom axe config.

6. **Guardrails & Tooling**  
   - Coverage thresholds ratcheted.  
   - `eslint-plugin-vitest` prevents focused/disabled tests and enforces assertion usage.  
   - Playwright configured with retries, future trace/video retention toggles.

7. **Deferred Enhancements**  
   - Playwright rate-limit & checkout paths, catalog filter matrix, CI reporting, contact snapshots, webhook signature simulations.

## 4. Progress Timeline (Sessions 1–4)

| Session | Focus | Tests Added | Coverage Impact | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **1** (2025-02-17) | Reservations queries | +19 | Lines 26.76% → 33.17% | ReservationQueries, PuppyQueries, WebhookEventQueries suites landed. |
| **2** (2025-02-17) | External clients | +22 | Lines 33.17% → 35.26% | Stripe & PayPal client mocks, 100% coverage each. |
| **3** (2025-02-17) | Marketing pages | +22 | Lines 35.26% → 44.15% | About, Puppies, Reviews page tests. |
| **4** (2025-02-17) | UI Smoke & A11y | +74 | Lines 44.15% → **52.57%** | Contact form UI (22), accessibility pages (36) & components (16); jest-axe + canvas installed. |

**Overall:** 98 → 235 tests, +137 total. All vitest suites pass; Playwright extensions remain optional backlog.

## 5. Verification & Quality Assurance

Validated via `npm run test -- --run --coverage`:
```
All files: 52.57% lines | 65.41% branches | 74.88% functions | 52.57% statements
Test Files 25 passed (25) — Tests 235 passed (235)
```

### Verification Checklist
- ✅ Coverage targets met (lines ≥50%, functions ≥70%, branches ≥60%).  
- ✅ 235 tests green; execution <10s.  
- ✅ External integrations (Stripe, PayPal, hCaptcha) mocked and fully covered.  
- ✅ Accessibility coverage automated across pages/components.  
- ✅ Documentation aligned (plan, progress, summary, verification, checklist).  
- ✅ Risks tracked: remaining gaps limited to deferred E2E/CI work.

### Risk Assessment
- Resolved: contact validation, payment edge cases, rate limiting, accessibility, external client failures.  
- Remaining (acceptable): rate-limit E2E flow, filter matrix E2E, checkout E2E (unit coverage offsets risk).  
- Optional follow-ups: CI artifacts, coverage badge, contact payload snapshots, webhook signature simulations, Playwright trace/video configuration.

  - Additional suites for analytics, config, captcha, env utilities.
- [x] Config updates: `vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.setup.ts`, `package.json` (jest-axe, @axe-core/react, canvas).
- [x] Commands verified:
  - `npm run test -- --run`
  - `npm run test -- --run --coverage`
  - `npm run test` (threshold enforcement)

**Outstanding (deferred):**  
E2E rate-limit + filter matrices, checkout stubs, CI JUnit/coverage badge, optional contact snapshots, webhook signature mismatch handling, email fallback logging.

## 7. Conclusion & Next Steps

The Sprint 5 coverage initiative delivered a durable safety net across the highest-risk surfaces. With >52% line coverage, 235 automated tests, and strict thresholds enforced, the codebase is prepared for production changes. Deferred items are documented for future sprints and do not block release readiness.

**Recommended future focus (optional):**
1. Implement Playwright extensions (rate-limit, checkout, filter matrix) and capture trace/video artifacts.
2. Publish CI artifacts (JUnit, coverage badge) and integrate with dashboards.
3. Address remaining optional refinements (contact snapshots, webhook signature simulations, email fallback logging).
