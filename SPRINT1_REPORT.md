# Sprint 1 Report

## Completed
- Seeded Supabase with demo parents, litters, puppies, reservations, and inquiries (`supabase/seeds/initial_seed.sql`).
- Added typed data access layer (`lib/supabase/types.ts`, `lib/supabase/queries.ts`) with filtering helpers and Vitest coverage.
- Refined global layout: persistent header/footer, sticky contact bar, and refreshed home hero messaging.
- Delivered catalog (`/puppies`) with live filters, skeleton/loading states, and Supabase-backed cards.
- Built puppy detail view (`/puppies/[slug]`) featuring gallery, lineage, status, related listings, and reserve CTA placeholder.
- Authored supporting pages (`/about`, `/policies`, `/contact`) plus a contact form shell for future Supabase wiring.
- Updated Playwright smoke test and ran MCP-backed e2e, unit, lint, typecheck, and production builds.

## Metrics & Verification
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run e2e -- --reporter=list`
- `npm run build`

## Pending / Deferred
- Populate real media assets and replace placeholder CDN URLs as content becomes available.
- Implement Supabase-powered inquiry submissions and channel deep links (Sprint 2).
- Wire Stripe/PayPal deposit actions and webhook handling (Sprint 3).
- Add GA4 & Meta Pixel once analytics strategy is confirmed.

## Notes
- Catalog routes use ISR revalidation at 60 seconds; adjust if inventory turnover requires faster updates.
- `ContactFormShell` currently acknowledges submissions only; hook up to Supabase + notifications in Sprint 2.
- Playwright MCP configured via `~/.codex/config.toml` to support inline trace review during UI iterations.
